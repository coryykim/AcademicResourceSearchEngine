# Scrum Design Approach to Building an Academic Resource Catalogue and Search Engine

## A conceptual approach towards building a functional resource catalogue and search engine through the use of Requirement, Workflow, Use Case, etc diagrams.

This repository captures a code-less project built in a Software Engineering class but aims to exist as its own separate entity. A majority of parts within this repository are separate from the assignment done at my academic institution but aim to use concepts and ideas taught within the class to further strengthen an understanding of what it's like to work in a professional agile development environment.

### Goals for this project:
1. Grasp the utility of project diagrams while understanding how to format and build them
2. Familiarize myself with the roles and role dynamics within a Scrum team (mainly acting as a Scrum Master)
3. Get comfortable with my own personal capabilties by guaging the ammount of work I can allocate to each sprint
4. Build a framework for a project I can come back to and work on as I develop my technical skills

## Diagram 1 : Use Case Diagram

The Use Case Diagram shown is very bareboned and only highlights 5-8 use cases and even fewer actors but acts to capture the potential interplay between these actors and the systems implemented in this application. The app intends to have many features like a built-in note-taking interface, an offline mode, and other automated searching/recommendation features; these diagrams (and future ones) will most likely highlight none of these features.
