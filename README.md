# Scrum Design Approach to Building an Academic Resource Catalogue and Search Engine

## A conceptual approach towards building a functional resource catalogue and search engine through the use of Requirement, Workflow, Use Case, etc diagrams.

This repository captures a code-less project built in a Software Engineering class but aims to exist as its own separate entity. A majority of parts within this repository are separate from the assignment done at my academic institution but aim to use concepts and ideas taught within the class to further strengthen an understanding of what it's like to work in a professional agile development environment.

#### Goals for this project:
1. Grasp the utility of project diagrams while understanding how to format and build them
2. Familiarize myself with the roles and role dynamics within a Scrum team (mainly acting as a Scrum Master)
4. Get comfortable with my own personal capabilties by guaging the ammount of work I can allocate to each sprint
5. Build a framework for a project I can come back to and work on as I develop my technical skills
